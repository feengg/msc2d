Introduction
============

msc2d is a program library to create the Morse-Smale complex for a
given manifold and a scalar field. It is a partly algorithm implement
base on the paper "Hierarchical Morse-Smale Complexes for Piecewise 
Linear 2-Manifolds".

Build 
===========

build requirement:
[cmake](version 2.4 or latter)
[boost](version 1.36 or latter)


Explaination
============

The input data is two files: a mainfold mesh(just support obj file now)
and a scalar field file, and the output is a msc file.

File format:
-----------

obj file:(please reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file)

scalar field file: 
first line: an integer N ( the number of vertices for the mesh)
following N lines, each is : a scalar value

msc file:(please reference src/msc2d/mscomplex.cc)
